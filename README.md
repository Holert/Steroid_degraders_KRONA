# Steroid_degraders_KRONA

KRONA charts show taxonomic affiliations of predicted bacterial steroid-degradation proteins in 109 metagenome datasets. Protein taxonomy was assessed by BLAST analysis aginst the non-redundant Refseq protein database and lowest common ancestor analysis. Steroid-degradation proteins were predicted using 23 Hidden Markov models representing 10 known steroid-degradation protein families. 

The KRONA color code can be changed to show the pathway completeness for all taxonomic ranks. This shows to how many steroid-degradation protein families a particular taxon has been assigned (out of 10 analyzed protein families).
